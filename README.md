# OHIS-interface
According to [the OHIS-reference document](https://open-headset-interconnect-standard.github.io/ohis/Open-Headset-Interconnect-Standard.pdf):
> With the Open Headset Interconnect Standard, or OHIS, the club/EOC can build/buy one adapter for every
radio which stays with that radio, and the user only needs to build/buy one adapter for their specific headset
which stays with their headset, and now they can achieve full interoperability with only O(N) adapters.

This repository will contain OHIS-interface boards to the following handheld radios:

## Yaesu FT-65E
* [Radio tecnical doc](https://github.com/LieBtrau/digital-walkie-talkie/blob/master/SoftwareModem/Yaesu_FT65-E.ipynb)
* [OHIS FT-65E interface, version 1.0.0 (Altium online viewer)](https://365.altium.com/files/52D7B6AC-E25B-4030-AC4F-B64CA4D52889)

## Midland G9 Pro
* [Radio technical doc](https://github.com/LieBtrau/digital-walkie-talkie/blob/master/SoftwareModem/MidlandG9pro.ipynb)

These interfaces might work on more radios, but they have only been tested on the radios listed above.
