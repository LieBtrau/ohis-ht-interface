# OHIS-interface
According to [the OHIS-reference document](https://open-headset-interconnect-standard.github.io/ohis/Open-Headset-Interconnect-Standard.pdf):
> With the Open Headset Interconnect Standard, or OHIS, the club/EOC can build/buy one adapter for every
radio which stays with that radio, and the user only needs to build/buy one adapter for their specific headset
which stays with their headset, and now they can achieve full interoperability with only O(N) adapters.

This repository will contain OHIS-interface boards to the following handheld radios:
* Yaesu FT-65E
* Midland G7 Pro

These interfaces might work on more radios, but they have only been tested on the radios listed above.
